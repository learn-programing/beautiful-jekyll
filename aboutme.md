 Piotr - I'm one of the thousands of Software Engineers. It took me only 6 years to became one of the top 1% of developers in the world and work as Chief Software Architect for Crossover. I've spent last 2 years teaching people programming and with this blog I want to share my hints with wider audience so you also can be a successful Software Enginner.

No - I'm not one of those fatty programmers not leaving his basement. I'm diver, marathon runner, mountain climber, traveller and programming mentor. From time to time I will share details of my hobbys to motivate you and show programmers are not so boring ;)

Why do I do this? It's just another step in my journey, step to share the knowledge which was shared with me over the years, step to help you to live better life, step to support you in becoming the true Software Engineer.
