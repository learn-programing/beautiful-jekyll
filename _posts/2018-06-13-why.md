It's just another step in my journey, step to share the knowledge which was shared with me over the years, step to help you to achieve better life, step to support you in becoming the true Software Engineer.

Who am I? 
I'm Piotr - one of the thousands of Software Engineers. It took me only 6 years to became one of the top 1% of developers in the world and work as Chief Software Architect for Crossover. I've spent last 2 years teaching people programming and with this blog I want to share my hints to wider audience so you also can be a successful Software Enginner.
